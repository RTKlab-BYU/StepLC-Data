# SCP_LF
Single cell workflow for label free with Jupyter notebook and data manage system

# How to Use
## Installing Github Jupiter Notebook Workflow:  
1.	Download Visual Studio Code with Python  
2.	Download and unzip the repository from https://github.com/RTKlab-BYU/SCP_LF  
3.	Open the folder in VS Code  
4.	Open a new terminal and type “pip install -r requirements.txt’ and then hit enter.  
## Analyzing the Proteome:  
1.	Place the output files from Proteome Discoverer in your unzipped folder. make sure Abundances was exported from PD    
2.	Open Single_cell_workflow.ipynb.  
3.	First decide if you want automatically exported files, if so near the top of the notebook change WRITE_OUTPUT = True.  
a.	Average ID’s and the corresponding standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals, CVs, protein lists, principal components, and volcano graph comparisons will be exported.  
4.	Name your input files:  
a.	Change the dictionary in the filelist variable which is near the bottom of the notebook to have the names of your Proteome Discoverer output.  
i.	“input1” is your Proteins.txt file or combined_proteins.tsv or diann-output.pg_matrix.tsv  
ii.	“input2” is your PeptideGroups.txt file or combined_peptides.tsv or diann-output.pr_matrix.tsv  
i.	“input3” is anything for PD or combined_proteins.tsv or diann-output.pg_matrix.tsv  
ii.	“input4” is anything for PD or combined_peptides.tsv without MBR or diann-output.pr_matrix.tsv without MBR.  
iv.	“input5” is your InputFiles.txt file.  
v.	“process_app” should be set to “PD” for Proteome Discoverer, "FragPipe" for Fragpipe or "DIANN" for DIANN.  
b.	To add multiple analyses add more dictionaries in curly brackets separated by commas with the same variables defined.  
c.	Change SETTINGS_FILE to the name of the file   
d.	If you place any PD files in subdirectories please add the sub directory followed by “/”  
5.	Set the SETTINGS_FILE variable to be equal to the file name you make in the next step enclosed by quotation marks.  
6.	Create the SETTINGS_FILE  
   a.	In Excel or another spreadsheet application open “settings_test.txt”.  
   b.	The “Conditions” should contain unique identifiers that will be used in most graphs.  
   c.	The filter_in column will be equal to the filename convention you used in naming your raw files    
   i.	If you used multiple Proteome Discoverer analyses in step 4b, then add @ and the index of the analysis containing the files for this group starting with 0, not 1.    
   d.	filter_out should be equal to the pattern of any files you don’t want included in this group that match the filter_in convention, if any. Can be left blank if there are none.    
   e.	Any other columns are optional, unless you are using grouped, stacked, or grouped_stacked ID/CV graphs, with any grouping besides “ID_Mode”. In that case column names can be set as the grouping variables they will appear in the order they are in the SETTINGS FILE  
   f.	Save as a tab separated txt within your unzipped folder
